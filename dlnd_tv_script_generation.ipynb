    "## Build the Neural Network\n",
    "Implement an RNN using PyTorch's [Module class](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#torch.nn.Module). You may choose to use a GRU or an LSTM. To complete the RNN, you'll have to implement the following functions for the class:\n",
    " - `__init__` - The initialize function. \n",
    " - `init_hidden` - The initialization function for an LSTM/GRU hidden state\n",
    " - `forward` - Forward propagation function.\n",
    " \n",
    "The initialize function should create the layers of the neural network and save them to the class. The forward propagation function will use these layers to run forward propagation and generate an output and a hidden state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The output of this model should be the *last* batch of word scores** after a complete sequence has been processed. That is, for each input sequence of words, we only want to output the word scores for a single, most likely, next word.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure to stack the outputs of the lstm to pass to your fully-connected layer, you can do this with `lstm_output = lstm_output.contiguous().view(-1, self.hidden_dim)`\n",
    "2. You can get the last batch of word scores by shaping the output of the final, fully-connected layer like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# reshape into (batch_size, seq_length, output_size)\n",
    "output = output.view(batch_size, -1, self.output_size)\n",

    "I know that the training code was not supposed to be modified but I needed make the code run on my machine, which had all the latest libraries so I edited it for compatibility.  Finally, with 20 epochs I was able to get the loss below 3.5.  The sequence_length I just set to the average of one line, because I thought a script would be best broken down by lines.  I ended up using a batch_size of 256 because I think that made things train better with respect to past weights.  If I understand correctly, the detach that I had to add only comes into play after a batch completes.  I wasted a lot of my GPU hours trying to get this to work on the Udacity workspace, but moving it to my machine gave me more power and freedom to figure it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "My original learning rate of 0.0001 was working, but I increased it hoping to shave some time off the training.  I experimented with a number of rates, but .0003 felt like a good middle-ground between the standard guesses for this criterion.  It took a full two days for me to realize that the output size needs to be about the same size as the vocab length.  But when I thought about it, it made sense that you would want to have as many choices for output as there are unique words in the original text.\n",
    "\n",
    "After several attempts stalled out at a loss of about 4.2, I increased the hidden dimensions to 512 from an original 256.  This seemed to help enough to get across the finish line.  The two-layer LSTM was just a guess based off of previous guided assignments.  The embedding dim is much smaller now at sixteen than what I started with, but I am still not sure that it's the right number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having an embedding layer that was smaller than the hidden layers was counter-intuitive, but enough googling pointed me in the right direction.  I was able to up the hidden dimension considerably on my machine and still have it train at a reasonable time.  This helped increase the robustness of the model.  I experimented with more than two layers, but it never seemed to produce consistent benefits.  I stuck with two because that was used in a previous exercise.\n",
